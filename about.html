                <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">Roadfood means great regional meals along highways, in small towns and in city neighborhoods. 
                    It is sleeves-up fare made by cooks, bakers, pitmasters,
                     and sandwich-makers who are America’s culinary folk artists.</p>
                <br>
                <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">Roadfood restaurants are almost always casual and affordable. 
                    They are diners, small-town cafes, seaside shacks, drive-ins, barbecues, and bake shops. 
                    The best of them are colorful places enjoyed by locals (and savvy travelers) 
                    for their character as well as their menu.</p>

        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 15px">Roadfood first was published as a guidebook in 1977 and is now celebrating its 10th edition. In 2000, Roadfood.com was created to expand the mission of sharing memorable local eateries along highways and back roads with hungry travelers. Roadfood.com strives to be a great resource on any device, and a place where a community of food lovers from all over the country (and the globe) share road-trip reports, delicious food photos, and opinions on all things culinary.</p>

        <br>
        <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">For any food lover who’s ever heard the call of the open road, Jane and Michael Stern have been trusted, 
            trailblazing guides for over 40 years. After meeting at Yale, where they came to study art, 
            they began a collaboration that has yielded over forty books, including the good-eats guide Roadfood, 
            The Lexicon of Real American Food, cookbooks Square Meals and American Gourmet, 
            and pop-culture best-sellers Elvis World, The Encyclopedia of Bad Taste, and Way Out West.</p>
        <br>

        <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">Jane and Michael Stern drive around America looking for good food. As the creators of Roadfood, 
            the James Beard Award-winning authors have worked to both preserve and celebrate regional American dishes from coast-to-coast, 
            ensuring that whether someone is tooling through Tulsa or rounding the bend outside of Boston,
            they’ll know just where to taste the most authentic, local flavors imaginable.</p>
        <br>

        <p style="font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif;">The Sterns have won three James Beard journalism awards for their monthly column in Gourmet magazine,
             which took readers to the best restaurants in small towns and cities all around the country. 
             They are weekly contributors to “The Splendid Table” on Public Radio.</p>
